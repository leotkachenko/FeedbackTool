# Angular + MongoDB + Node.js Pet Project

This is a small pet project developed using Angular, MongoDB, and Node.js.

## Overview
The project aims to showcase the integration of Angular (a popular TypeScript-based web application framework), MongoDB (a flexible NoSQL database), and Node.js (a JavaScript runtime) for building end-to-end web applications with file uploading capabilities.

## Features

- **Angular:** The project is developed using Angular, a powerful framework for building web applications with TypeScript. It provides a robust set of tools for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **MongoDB:** The project utilizes MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database. MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format, making it suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Node.js:** The project uses Node.js as the server-side runtime environment. Node.js allows for building scalable and high-performance applications using JavaScript.
- **RESTful APIs:** The project demonstrates the implementation of RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, allowing clients to interact with the application and perform CRUD operations on the MongoDB database.
- **File Uploading:** The project incorporates file uploading capabilities, allowing users to upload files (e.g., images, documents) to the server. It showcases the handling and storage of uploaded files using Node.js and MongoDB.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** The project leverages the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently, providing a responsive user experience.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide an example and starting point for building end-to-end web applications using Angular on the front end, MongoDB as the database, and Node.js for the server-side logic. It showcases how these technologies can be combined to create a modern and efficient web application with file uploading capabilities.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git`
2. Install Node.js if you haven't already: [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/)
3. Install MongoDB and ensure it is running locally or provide the connection parameters to an existing MongoDB instance.
4. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the Node.js server: `npm start`
6. Access the web application at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project as per your requirements, leveraging the end-to-end capabilities and file uploading possibilities.
